# Cury Legacy

Legacy or compact scripts retained for reference.

## Files

- `cury-mini.shelly.js`
  - Use case: Single-file compact fallback when memory/readability tradeoffs are acceptable.
  - User persona: Maintenance engineer needing a concise script for quick rollback or constrained deployments.

## Note

Prefer scripts in `../light-language/` + `../button-control/` for clearer maintenance.
